                    <h4>1. What is an "earthmile"?</h4>
                    <p>Put simply, an earthmile is a unit for the point system we use to reward you for your healthy, earth-loving, green behaviours. </p>

                    <h4>2. How do I get earthmiles?</h4>
                    <p>Very easily – when you register on our app, you will be taken to a set up page where you can link your account to a tracking app that you use. Once you link it, we will automatically pull your activities data from your apps and award you with earthmiles! Keep checking your profile for your latest earthmiles balance.</p>

					<h4>3. What gets me earthmiles?</h4>
                    <p>Today we can award you earthmiles for walking, running, and cycling. A healthier you is the first step to a healthier, happier world! But watch this space closely as we have exciting plans of expanding the scope of what earns earthmiles, including fitness, health-related, community-oriented and environmentally positive behaviours.</p>

					<h4>4. Help! The app I use to track my walking / running / cycling is not on the list on the set up page.</h4>
                    <p>Don’t worry! We are quickly linking to more and more apps to make sure your favourite tracking apps are included. In the meantime if you want to check out the current rewards, you could give the available apps a try.</p>

					<h4>5. What happens when I use two apps – do I win double earthmiles?</h4>
                    <p>Sorry, no. We will be removing the duplication on the basis of the activity time stamp, location and duration.</p>

					<h4>6. Are there any checks on how I get my activities done?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, indeed. We check for the following issues and if we spot any erratic data coming from you we will flag it to you before removing it from your earthmiles score.</p>
                    <ul class="faq-ul">
                    <li>Walking is trackable throughout the day; running and cycling data is limited to once a day</li>

					<li>From any one user account we will only accept data from one country on any given day; alternating locations would give rise to a red flag</li>

					<li>The data is cleaned for lazy runs and any stray data picked up while moving in vehicles. If you disagree with our deletions, let us know and someone will get in touch to discuss</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>7. How do you convert my activities into earthmiles?</h4>
                    <p>We have a proprietary model based on extensive user surveys on the basis of which we convert user activity data into earthmiles. While in beta mode, we will be refining these conversion ratios so you might see some changes in the number of earthmiles your activity gets you</p>

					<h4>8. What is the difference between credit available and earthmiles?</h4>
                    <p>On the rewards centre you will see a number for “credit available”. This is the total number of earthmiles you have remaining, reduced by all the earthmiles you have already redeemed on the rewards centre. Your friends and everyone will see your earthmiles balance, which is all the earthmiles you have earned so far, including any you have spent. It’s a number to be proud of!</p>

					<h4>9. Can I see what my friends are doing on earthmiles?</h4>
                    <p>Absolutely! You can search and add your friends from facebook. You will then be able to see their activity feed which will show up on your home page, and also visit their profile where you can check out how many earthmiles they have.</p>

					<h4>10. Can I invite a friend who is not currently using earthmiles?</h4>
                    <p>Of course! You can send them an email invitation. If your friend joins and mentions you as a referral, we will award you and them 50 earthmiles as a bonus!</p>

					<h4>11. Why do you need me to fill out the About Me section?</h4>
                    <p>It’s useful to have your basic info on your profile page so your friends can identify you. We ask for some necessary information such as your name, age, location etc., so we can ensure the working of the app is smooth for you. We also have some optional data for you to fill when you set up your profile, which helps us direct better more suitable rewards to  you and helps our partners know what sort of users like their rewards. Your personal data is safe with us – you can read the full privacy statement here.</p>

					<h4>12. What sort of rewards can I expect to see on the rewards centre?</h4>
                    <p>Earthmiles is all about health, the environment and the community. You will see fantastic rewards that sit within our philosophy of creating a healthier happier world.</p>

					<h4>13. Can I delete my account?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, anytime you decide to do so, you can delete your account and we will delete all your personal information along with it.</p>

                        It started with three friends who wanted to combine their passions for fitness and the environment with exciting technologies. We researched tons of ideas and realised that technology today has made it possible for us to create new models of individual accountability and incentivization. These models have the power to transform traditional ways of conducting CSR programmes and marketing campaigns. And thus Earthmiles was born!

                        We’re a young start-up based with offices in London’s Silicon Roundabout. Our small team is always looking for fresh talent so drop us a line if you’re curious about working with us.

                    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>

                    <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may use your account settings&nbsp;to change your information at any time.&nbsp;If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Rewards</strong></p>

                <p>When you create an Earthmiles account, you will automatically become eligible to start redeeming various offers of free and discounted products and services (&quot;Rewards&quot;) on the section of our Services that displays and offers them (&quot;Rewards Centre&quot;). The Rewards are offered in conjunction with the companies who provide and/or honour Earthmiles Rewards (&quot;Rewards Partners&quot;). The specific laws, rules, and regulations governing certain promotions or contests through the Rewards Centre may vary, and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those laws, rules and regulations.</p>

                <p>An &quot;earthmile&quot; represents a point value awarded for walking, running, cycling, or any other activity that Earthmiles may wish to include in the future (&quot;Qualifying Activities&quot;). Earthmiles reserves the right to change the scope of Qualifying Activities without your express consent. Qualifying Activities data is further subject to checks by Earthmiles to try to ascertain the activities are genuine and correct, although Earthmiles&nbsp;provides no assurance to the accuracy or validity of such data. The conversion system to convert a Qualifying Activity into &quot;earthmiles&quot; is the property of Earthmiles. Your Earthmiles account will maintain a record of your accrued balance of &quot;earthmiles&quot; as well as any account credits and debits. Your &quot;earthmiles&quot; may not be transferred and cannot be combined with &quot;earthmiles&quot; from another user&#39;s account unless specifically made available to you under certain conditions that are set by Earthmiles. These &quot;earthmiles&quot; are not redeemable for cash or any other form of currency or credit, and have no fixed or ascertainable cash value.</p>

                <p>Rewards are issued by our Rewards Partners and may be tendered to you in the form of electronic promotion codes, offline reward mailers, goods, services, or a combination of these means or in gift certificate format by the Rewards partner or by Earthmiles. You may receive Rewards by redeeming &quot;earthmiles&quot; as per the terms and conditions for each Reward as described in the reward coupon [deleted PDF just to be safe] emailed to you for, which may vary for each Reward. These terms &amp; conditions may be adjusted by the Rewards Partner or Earthmiles at any time. Rewards are subject to change from time to time at the discretion of the Reward Partner and/or Earthmiles, and specific Rewards are not guaranteed to be available at all times.</p>

                <p>Rewards Partners are entities and individuals, which may include brands, manufacturers, retailers, service providers, and other third parties, that provide and/or honour Earthmiles Rewards. The list of participating Rewards Partners is subject to change at any time. Rewards Partners are not agents, employees, contractors, partners, or subcontractors of Earthmiles. Participation by any Reward Partner should not be taken as an endorsement, either express or implied, of the Rewards Partner or its products or services by Earthmiles or any of the companies that provide exercise tracking technologies.</p>

                <p>Rewards and their use are subject to (i) availability, (ii) terms and conditions specified by the Rewards Partners and/or as listed on the actual Reward, including expiration dates, (iii) your ability to purchase the reward with sufficient &quot;earthmiles&quot; collected by doing Qualifying Activities that meet all our checks, and (iii) may be subject to change at any time.</p>

                <p>Earthmiles shall determine the total number of &quot;earthmiles&quot; that you must redeem to obtain a Reward and may change this number at any time, with or without notice. Some offers may &nbsp;be a onetime offer per use. Offers vary from time to time and availability may be highly limited.</p>

                <p>Rewards Partners or Earthmiles may, at their sole discretion, choose to offer Rewards to select groups or to individual participants.</p>

                <p>In the event a Rewards Partner refuses to honour a Reward for any reason, Earthmiles&#39; sole obligation will be to credit your account for the number of &quot;earthmiles&quot; that were to be redeemed for the Reward.</p>

                <p>Except as expressly stated in the Terms, Rewards cannot be returned, exchanged or refunded, or replaced by cash, &quot;earthmiles&quot;, or other Rewards.</p>

                <p>You must promptly notify Earthmiles of (i) any discrepancy in the Rewards, (ii) non-recept of Rewards shipment. Upon receipt of such notification, Earthmiles will investigate, and may, if appropriate, (i) correct such discrepancies, or (ii) facilitate receipt by liaising with the Rewards Partner, if appropriate for Earthmiles to do so under given circumstances.</p>

                <p>You are responsible for any fees&nbsp;and charges for any personal or corporate tax liabilities, if any, related to your participation in the Earthmiles Rewards Centre.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Accuracy of &quot;earthmiles&quot; earned</strong></p>

                <p>Earthmiles will make reasonable efforts to accurately account for accrual and redemption of &quot;earthmiles&quot;. Earthmiles reserves the right (i) to audit your account at any time for compliance with these Terms, without notice to you and (ii) to change accrued &quot;earthmiles&quot; points totals without notification if such audit reveals errors, inaccuracies, miscalculations or non-compliance. If you become aware of any discrepancy in your &quot;earthmiles&quot; total balance, accruals, redemptions, or calculations, you must notify us, but in no event more than thirty days after your account balance changes as a result of a transaction. Otherwise, &quot;earthmiles&quot; balance calculations will be deemed accurate, and you waive any claim for future adjustment or adjudication.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Modification and Interpretation of Rewards Centre</strong>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>&nbsp;Earthmiles may modify, cancel, or terminate the Rewards Centre&rsquo;s rules, processes, regulations, Rewards Partners, Rewards, and special offers at any time, with or without notice. All interpretations of the Rewards Centre rules and terms provided are made at the sole discretion of Earthmiles. Earthmiles may: (i) change the amount of &quot;earthmiles&quot; in any account; (ii) change the number of &quot;earthmiles&quot; required to redeem a Reward; (iii) impose caps and/or fees on &quot;earthmiles&quot; earnings and/or on the redemption of &quot;earthmiles&quot;; or (iv) change the list of Rewards available. Your continued participation in the Rewards Centre after any posted modification of the Rewards Centre in these Terms indicates your acceptance of the modification.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Name and Value of Rewards Program Currency</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

Earthmiles also reserves the right to determine the value of any new currency as compared to &quot;earthmiles&quot; and to automatically convert your current &quot;earthmiles&quot; to any new currency.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Correcting Mistakes in Earthmiles Balances and Payments</strong></p>

                <p>We reserve the right to fix any processing errors we discover. We will correct any processing errors by debiting or crediting the payment method used (namely use of &quot;earthmiles earned or paid&quot;) for the erroneous transaction.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Fees</strong></p>

                <p>As of the date stated above, the Services are provided to you for free. Joining Earthmiles does not require a payment. Purchasing Rewards&nbsp;is only possible through the acquisition of activity points (&quot;earthmiles&quot;) and we do not charge a fee for this service directly. We reserve the right to implement fees for the Services at any time by providing you notice.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties</strong></p>

                <p>Your use of the Services, including, without limitation, your use of any Content accessible through the Services, and your interactions and dealings with any Services users, is at your sole risk.

Earthmiles does not warrant uninterrupted use or operation of the Services or your access to any content. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from the Services will create any warranty regarding Earthmiles that is not expressly stated in these Terms. Some jurisdictions may prohibit a disclaimer of warranties and you may have other rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.</p>

                <p>Without limiting this section, Earthmiles makes no warranties whatsoever, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or usefulness of any information contained ore references in the Services. Health-related information changes frequently and therefore information contained of the Services may be outdated, incomplete or incorrect. Earthmiles does not assume any risk whatsoever for your use of the Services or the information contained on the Services.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>

                <p>You will not hold Earthmiles responsible for any loss you may incur as a result of Earthmiles taking any of the actions described in the Terms nor for other users&#39; actions or inactions, including, without limitation, Content they post, Rewards they redeem and Rewards offered by Rewards Partners.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Neither Earthmiles nor its suppliers or licensors will be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses (even if Earthmiles or any supplier or licensor has been advised of the possibility of these damages), arising out of or relating to your access to or use of, or your inability to&nbsp;access or use, the Services or any Content. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.</p>

                <p>Earthmiles is not involved in the actual transaction between Rewards Partners and Users. While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programmes, we have no control over and do not guarantee the quality, safety or legality of items advertised, the truth or accuracy of Rewards, the truth or accuracy of feedback, comments, or other Content posted by users on our Services, the ability of Rewards Partners to provide the Reward, the ability of users to pay for the items, or that a user or Rewards Partner will actually complete a transaction or return an item.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Please do not assume that the offer, sale, purchase, export, or import of any item is valid and legal simply because it is listed on the Rewards Centre.</p>

                <p>You accept sole responsibility for the legality of your actions under laws applying to you and the legality of any items listed in our Rewards Centre</p>

                <p>Although we use techniques that aim to verify the accuracy and truth of information provided by our users, user verification on the internet is difficult. Earthmiles cannot and does not confirm, and is not responsible for ensuring, the accuracy and truthfulness of users&#39; purported identities or the validity of their data regarding their activities, or the information they post on our Services.</p>

                <p>We cannot guarantee continuous or secure access to our Services, and operation of our sites may be interfered with by numerous factors outside our control.

                <p>Regardless of the previous paragraphs,&nbsp;if we are found to be liable, the maximum total liability of Earthmiles and its suppliers and licensors to you for all claims under these Terms, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, is GBP 100. Each provision of these terms that provides for a limitation of liability, disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages is to allocate the risks under these Terms between the parties This allocation is an essential element of the basis of the bargain between the parties. Each of these provisions is severable and independent of all other provisions of these Terms&nbsp;the&nbsp;limitations in this section will apply even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Legal Disputes</strong></p>

                <p>Section headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of such section.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. We do not guarantee we will take action against all breaches of these Terms.</p>

                <p>We may amend these Terms at any time by email or by posting the amended terms on our Services. Except as stated elsewhere, all amended Terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted.&nbsp;</p>
